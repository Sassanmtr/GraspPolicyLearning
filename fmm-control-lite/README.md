# fmm-control-lite

This is a ROS-free, interface-agnostic package to provide control actions for our fmm robot. The goal is to be able to use this package for the real fmm robot as well as a simulated one.

## Installation

```bash
pip install spatialmath-python roboticstoolbox-python qpsolvers osqp
```
